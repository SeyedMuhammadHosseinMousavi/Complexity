# Complexity
Complexity

### Definition
- The complexity of an algorithm is the amount of resources required to run the algorithm.
- Particular focus is given to computation time (generally measured by the number of needed operations) and memory storage requirements. 
- The complexity of a problem is the complexity of the best algorithms that allow solving the problem.
- The complexity refers to the study of how computational resources (like time, memory, or energy) are consumed by algorithms or systems.
- Complexity helps us evaluate and compare the efficiency and feasibility of solutions for computational problems.

### Importance
- The calculation of algorithmic complexity is crucial as it helps evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of solutions to computational problems. 
- By analyzing complexity, we can determine how an algorithm scales with input size, predict its performance, and identify resource requirements such as time, memory, or energy. 
- This allows for informed decisions when choosing or designing algorithms, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness, especially for large-scale or resource-constrained applications.
- Understanding complexity is essential for balancing trade-offs and developing robust, scalable systems.
